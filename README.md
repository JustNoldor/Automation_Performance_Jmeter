# Performance Testing with JMeter

This project aims to conduct performance testing on the website [BlazeDemo](https://blazedemo.com/) using Apache JMeter. BlazeDemo is a sample airline booking website provided by BlazeMeter for demonstration and testing purposes.

# Prerequisites
Apache JMeter installed on your machine.

# Test Plan Overview
The JMeter test plan included in this project is designed to simulate user behavior on the BlazeDemo website. It includes the following components:

- Thread Group: Simulates virtual users interacting with the website.
- HTTP Requests: Various HTTP requests corresponding to actions performed by users, such as browsing flights, selecting flights, and submitting bookings.
- Assertions: Verifies the correctness of server responses.
- Listeners: Collects and displays test results for analysis.

# How to Run the Test
#### Download and Install Apache JMeter:
 If you haven't already, download and install Apache JMeter on your machine.

#### Clone or Download this Repository: 
Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

#### Open the Test Plan: 
Open the Automation_Performance_Jmeter.jmx file in Apache JMeter.

#### Configure Test Parameters:
 Adjust any test parameters such as number of threads, ramp-up period, and loop count according to your testing requirements.

#### Run the Test:
 Start the test by clicking the "Run" button in Apache JMeter.

#### Monitor Test Execution:
 Monitor the test execution in real-time using JMeter's built-in listeners. Pay attention to metrics such as response time, throughput, and error rate.

#### Analyzing Results:
 Once the test completes, analyze the results to identify any performance bottlenecks or issues. You can generate various reports using JMeter's reporting capabilities.

# Additional Notes
This test plan serves as a basic example and may need to be customized further based on specific testing scenarios and requirements.
Ensure that the BlazeDemo website is accessible and responsive during the test execution.
